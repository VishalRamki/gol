# Conway's Game Of Life Implementation

This is my implementation of Conway's Game Of Life in Rust + SDL2. It was mostly an excerise in getting SDL2 and rust to play with each other. I'm using this as a jumping off point for a small simulation game I am working on.

I figured people might be interesting in seeing this implmented using rust and Default SDL2.

## Building

1. Install SDL2 Following the instructions at their github page: [https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2)
2. Clone this repo.
3. `cargo run` in the repo.

## Release

I included a release on the release page for no real reason. You can download it and try it via a binary if you want.

## License

MIT. I guess.
